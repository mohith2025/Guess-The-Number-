This is my first ever game made by python language.
This a number guessing game made by using basic functions in python, such as while loop, if-elif-else statements. 
The working of the code is as follows:
It use import module to choose a number from a preset range to make it work smoother, then the number is stored into the variable, 
by creating 3 other variables and storing it to a input variable makes it easy for the initial code. 
Then I used while loop to check if the input given by user is either less than or greater than or equal to the number that was chosen initially, 
and using it along if statements make the game succesfull.
